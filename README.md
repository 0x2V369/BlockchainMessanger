# BlockchainMessanger

## BlockchainMessanger.sol 
  ### Messanger idea:
  - A simple project to create a 'blockchain messanger' (note, couldnt really call it a messanger since only the owner of the contract can update the message)
  - contract has 3 state variables, owner, msgCounter, lastMessage
    - owner - address type, that is assigned to contract deployer address
    - msgCounter - pretty self explanatory
    - lastMessage - last valid message sent to contract
